Edwin uses a keystroke notation different from Emacs, here's its
grammar.

<key-sequence> := (kbd <keystroke>+)

<keystroke> := <characters> | <special-characters> | <string> | <keystroke-with-modifiers>

<characters> := char-set:printing

<string> := "<characters>*"

<special-characters> := | return | space | tab
                        | backspace | delete
                        | left | right | up | down

<keystroke-with-modifiers> := (<modifier>+ <character>)

<modifier> := control | meta | super
