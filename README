EDWIN48
=======

This is an effort to modernize the Edwin codebase in MIT Scheme. The
goal is to make it run on modern Schemes.

Dependencies
============

Edwin48 depends on the terminfo library available at
git://git.a-chinaman.com/terminfo.  It's been imported to this module as a
git submodule. After the initial checkout, please run

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

to check out the terminfo submodule.

Edwin48 is being developed on NuScsh. NuScsh can be obtained via git:

    git clone git://a-chinaman.com/nuscsh

NuScsh has been tested on Ubuntu Hardy on i386 and x86-64. To build
Debian packages, run 'dpkg-buildpackage' in the nuscsh
directory. NuScsh can also be built on Mac OS X Leopard without any
modifications.
