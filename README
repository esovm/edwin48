EDWIN48
=======

This is an effort to modernize the Edwin codebase in MIT Scheme. The
goal is to make it run on modern Schemes.

Dependencies
============

Edwin48 depends on the terminfo library available at
git://git.a-chinaman.com/terminfo.  It's been imported to this module as a
git submodule. After the initial checkout, please run

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

to check out the terminfo submodule.

For current development we are trying to use scsh 0.7 which is built
on top of Scheme48 1.9. Follow these instructions to get scsh 0.7:

 hg clone http://www.s48.org/cgi-bin/hgwebdir.cgi/s48
 cd s48/
 ./autogen.sh
 autoconf
 ./configure
 make
 sudo make install

 cd ../
 hg clone https://scsh.googlecode.com/hg/ scsh
 cd scsh/
 autoreconf
 ./configure
 make
 sudo make install



Edwin48 was being developed on NuScsh. NuScsh can be obtained via git:

    git clone git clone git://a-chinaman.com/nuscsh

NuScsh has been tested on Ubuntu Hardy on i386 and x86-64. To build
Debian packages, run 'dpkg-buildpackage' in the nuscsh
directory. NuScsh can also be built on Mac OS X Leopard without any
modifications.

NuScsh is still used sometime when working on code that deal with TTYs.
