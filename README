EDWIN48
=======

This is an effort to modernize the Edwin codebase in MIT Scheme. The
goal is to make it run on Scheme48.

Dependencies
============

Edwin48 is being developed on Scheme48 1.3, however, due to a couple
of reader customizations, a patch to the build-in reader is
required. The patch can be found here:
